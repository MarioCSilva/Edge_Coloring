# Graph_Chromatic_Index

Project under the course of Advanced Algorithms with the main objective of finding the chromatic index of graphs using exhaustive search and also with greedy search heuristics.

## How to run

Have two directories created to store files, one called `graphs` and other `colored_graphs`.

Simply go to the `src` directory and run:

```
Usage: python3 main.py
    -h <Shows available arguments>
    -n <Number of Nodes for the Graph to be used for any operation: int>
    -ge <Generate Graph>
    -e <Exhaustive M-coloring Search>
    -v <Vizing Theorem>
    -p <Permutations>
    -gr <Greedy Search>
    -h <Heuristic to order Edges>
    -s <Show plot of graphs>
```
