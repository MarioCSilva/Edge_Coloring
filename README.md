# Graph_Chromatic_Index

Project under the course of Advanced Algorithms with the main objective of finding the chromatic index of graphs using exhaustive search and also with greedy search heuristics.

## How to run

Have two directories created to store files, one called `graphs` and other `colored_graphs`.

Go to the `src` directory and run:

`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

And then run the program with the desired arguments as follow:

```
Usage: python3 main.py
			-h <Shows available arguments>
			-n <Number of Nodes for the Graph to be used for any operation: int>
			-ge <Generate Graph>
			-e <Exhaustive M-coloring Search>
			-v <Vizing Theorem>
			-p <Permutations>
			-gr <Greedy Search>
			-o <Heuristic to order Edges>
			-r <Number of Times to Recolor Graph: int>
			-s <Show plot of graphs>
```
